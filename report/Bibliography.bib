	Abstract = {{A distributed sorting algorithm, inspired by how ant colonies sort their brood, is presented for use by robot swarms. The robots move randomly, do not
communicate, have no hierarchical organization, have no global  representation, can only perceive
objects just in front of them, but can distinguish between objects of twoo or more types with a certain degree of error. The probability that they pick
up or put down an object is modulated as a function of how many of the same objects they have met in the recent, past. This generates a positive
feed-back that is sufficient to coordinate the robots' activity, resulting in their sorting the objects into common clusters: While less efficient than a hierarchically
controlled sorting, this decentralized organization offers the advantages of simplicity, flexibility and robustness.}},

@article{citeulike:1857277,
	Abstract = {{An analogy with the way ant colonies function has suggested the
definition of a new computational paradigm, which we call ant system
(AS). We propose it as a viable new approach to stochastic combinatorial
optimization. The main characteristics of this model are positive
feedback, distributed computation, and the use of a constructive greedy
heuristic. Positive feedback accounts for rapid discovery of good
solutions, distributed computation avoids premature convergence, and the
greedy heuristic helps find acceptable solutions in the early stages of
the search process. We apply the proposed methodology to the classical
traveling salesman problem (TSP), and report simulation results. We also
discuss parameter selection and the early setups of the model, and
compare it with tabu search and simulated annealing using TSP. To
demonstrate the robustness of the approach, we show how the ant system
(AS) can be applied to other optimization problems like the asymmetric
traveling salesman, the quadratic assignment and the job-shop
scheduling. Finally we discuss the salient characteristics-global data
structure revision, distributed communication and probabilistic
transitions of the AS}},

@article{ballerini2008interaction,
	Abstract = {Numerical models indicate that collective animal behavior may emerge from simple local rules of interaction among the individuals. However, very little is known about the nature of such interaction, so that models and theories mostly rely on aprioristic assumptions. By reconstructing the three-dimensional positions of individual birds in airborne flocks of a few thousand members, we show that the interaction does not depend on the metric distance, as most current models and theories assume, but rather on the topological distance. In fact, we discovered that each bird interacts on average with a fixed number of neighbors (six to seven), rather than with all neighbors within a fixed metric distance. We argue that a topological interaction is indispensable to maintain a flock{\textquoteright}s cohesion against the large density changes caused by external perturbations, typically predation. We support this hypothesis by numerical simulations, showing that a topological interaction grants significantly higher cohesion of the aggregation compared with a standard metric one.},

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Knowing the number of species on Earth is one of the most basic yet elusive questions in science. Unfortunately, obtaining an accurate number is constrained by the fact that most species remain to be described and because indirect attempts to answer this question have been highly controversial. Here, we document that the taxonomic classification of species into higher taxonomic groups (from genera to phyla) follows a consistent pattern from which the total number of species in any taxonomic group can be predicted. Assessment of this pattern for all kingdoms of life on Earth predicts ∼8.7 million ($\pm$1.3 million SE) species globally, of which ∼2.2 million ($\pm$0.18 million SE) are marine. Our results suggest that some 86% of the species on Earth, and 91% in the ocean, still await description. Closing this knowledge gap will require a renewed interest in exploration and taxonomy, and a continuing effort to catalogue existing biodiversity data in publicly available databases.</p>
