/**
 * These are the directions each node can use to look for a neighbour. The idea
 * is that a node can have a neighbour in each of the following directions.
 * 
 * At this stage, as we only have the BasicNode implementation, which has a
 * square shape, we only have four possible neighbours, thus we have four
 * directions. Nothing stops us to create more complex nodes, hexagon shaped
 * for example, with 6 neighbours. In that case extra directions could be added
 * to describe the direction of a hexagon-node and its neighbour.
