\chapter*{Acknowledgements} % Acknowledgements section text

The challenge of taking a full-time postgraduate degree while working on a nearly full-time basis has proved to be very hard and I would have not be able to do it without the support and understanding of my manager Simon, who had a great deal of patience when I had to leave the office countless times to attend lectures and study for the exams.

I also would like to thank my close friends and family that made sure I was never short of support throughout the entire last year.
