/**
 * Formalises the public API for ant agents. Ants are implemented having limited
 * memory size and limited capability of collecting food. Different types of 
 * ants have different memory sizes and can collect different amounts of food.
 * Also the different types of ant interact differently with the environment so
 * each type of ants define a list of chemical stimulus and how much of each of
 * them the agent is able to lay in every interaction. 
 * 
 * Ant agent type that implements this interface should be declared as
 * enumeration, therefore they are singletons by definition.
