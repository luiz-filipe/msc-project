\chapter*{Abstract} % Abstract name

The natural world offer examples in which very limited agents when put together can create very sophisticated overall behaviour. Social insects have been incredibly successful in solving complex problems. This project proposes an agent oriented computational model that simulates certain aspects of social insects living in a colony. A brief introduction is given on emergence and the relevant aspects of distributed complex systems to this project, as well as some background information on social insects and their communication techniques.

Three experiments are proposed and run. The first experiment investigates the relationship between agents and pheromone concentration present in the environment. Second a study on velocity of reaction against predator warning stimulus is conducted. The last experiment investigates the effect of changing the radius of action of chemical stimuli on the colony's foraging capability.

This paper also proposes possible improvements to the proposed model and its implementation.
