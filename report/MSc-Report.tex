%	THESIS CONTENT - CHAPTERS
%----------------------------------------------------------------------

\ctparttext{In this first part, an introduction on the project is presented in Chapter \ref{ch:introduction}. Social insects and other background information,  such as emergence and agents are presented in Chapter \ref{ch:background-information}. Some of the applications of the concepts presented are highlighted at the end of the same chapter. The last chapter in this part, Chapter \ref{ch:model-overview}, introduces the generic computational model proposed by this paper and some parts of its implementation.} % Text on the Part 1 page describing  the content in Part 1

\ctparttext{In this part of the report two experiments are proposed and executed. Firstly an investigation on the colony's sensitivity in relation to present pheromone in the environment is carried. The objective of this experiment is to study how the agent's navigation capacity is affected by different concentrations of pheromone presented in the environment. 

The second experiment is a study on the affects that different diffusion rates of the forage pheromone will have on the colony's capability of foraging. The objective of this experiment is to determine if the colony's forage capacity is directly related to the increase of the pheromone radius. The results of each experiment are discussed in Chapter \ref{ch:experiments-and-observations}

Improvements to the model, to its implementation and further studies are proposed in Chapter \ref{ch:future-work}, followed by the conclusion of this paper.
