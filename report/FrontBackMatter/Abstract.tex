\chapter*{Abstract} % Abstract name

The natural world offer examples in which very limited agents when put together can create very sophisticated overall behaviour. Social insects have been incredibly successful in solving complex problems. This project proposes an agent oriented computational model that simulates certain aspects of social insects living in a colony. A brief introduction is given on emergence and the relevant aspects of distributed complex systems to this project, as well as some background information on social insects and their communication techniques.

Two experiments are proposed and run. The first experiment investigates the relationship between agents and pheromone concentration present in the environment. The second experiment investigates the effect of changing the radius of action of chemical stimuli on the colony's foraging capability.

The resulting conclusions taken from the data collected point out the issues risen by the node selection process implemented. Another two experiments are proposed for further investigation on the node selection as well as possible improvements on the model related to the issues found during the simulations.
