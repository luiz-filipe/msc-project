/**
 * This class is the basic implementation of Node. It hold references to
 * neighbour nodes and utility methods to navigate through them. The node shape
 * is a square, and its neighbours are represented by the north, east, south and
 * west field variables.
 * 
 * It is essential to keep this class as lightweight as possible, for it is
 * extensively used. To illustrate the point, a simulation with a reasonable
 * resolution like 300 lines by 100 columns will have 30 000 objects of this
 * class.
 * 
 * Note that this class is thread-safe as far as the agents are concerned. The
 * methods getNeighbour, setNeighbour and setNeighbours do expose the neighbour
 * nodes, but they were deliberately left without synchronisation because they
 * must be used only at setup time, that is, the environment does not change
 * after the simulation starts. getNeighbour is extensively used throughout the
 * simulation, so the overhead added by the synchronisation would not pay off.
