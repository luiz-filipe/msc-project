\chapter*{Abstract} % Abstract name

We are surrounded by cases in which very limited agents put together can give rise to very sophisticated overall behaviour. Social insects have been incredibly successful in solving complex problems. This project proposes an agent oriented computational model that simulates aspects of social insects.
A brief introduction is given on emergence and the relevant aspects of distributed complex systems to this project, as well as some background information on social insects and their communication techniques.

Three experiments are proposed and run. Firstly an experiment to investigate the best parameters to be used in the other simulations is carried. After a study on the velocity of reaction against predator warning stimulus is done. The last experiment investigates the affect of changing the radius of action of the chemical stimulus in the forage task.

Possible future improvements are also presented. Lastly a more technical description of the model implementation is given.
